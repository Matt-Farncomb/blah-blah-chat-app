A real-time chat app built  with Python and Javascript utlising Flask and Socket.IO.

Currently in the very early stages. Not yet got around to doing any designy css to any of it yet so it looks about as ugly as possible.

The user 'logs in' (no pw needed yet) and can chat with other users in multiple chat rooms or 'channels.'
